# README

This repository contains code related to exploring how to create hydrological trait-based PFTs, to subsequently assess their global distribution in LPJ-GUESS-HYD.

# TO DO's

### Trait relationships:
- [X]  rewrite functions for better testing
- [X]  test other trait relationships as starting points
- [ ] trouble-shoot optimisations ( currently PCA shows very
 different results)   :
- [ ] *double-check PCA code ( probably just something related to logging and -)*
- [ ] *Double-check analysis (sampling) code for new trait combinations *
- [ ] *increase traits in PCA ( e.g. from 28 to 100)*
- [ ] *LS-range is very dfferent between hypercube surfaces: Start by defining a supset of 28 starting values which all traits have in common, and which span the widest possible range ( use hypercube sampling?)*


### Related to LPJ-GUESS-HYD
- [X] fix daily LAI output
(additional points after meeting:)
- [X] Merge 'offline' version into most recent development branch ('Global') from Phillip
- [X ] Check what makes TrBE's less successful in comparison to 'offline' version.
	Established that the difference is due to random elements in fire routines
(end additional point)
#### trace phenology behaviour:
- [x ] implement lpjguess as executable locally in Xcode
- [X ] implement daily writeout of wscal in guess_hydraulics
- [ ] check deciduousness benefit is correctly implemented: plot timeseries of leaf drop and death by cavitation.
- [ ] check deciduousness cost: choose highest performing BE and BR, compare via LAI * SLA
- [ X ] check transpiration is properly turned off after deciduous trees have lost their leaves.
  It is not turned off, as phen=0 (lost leaves) can recover on a daily basis (i.e. grow leaves back daily)
- [X ]  change rhum input in guess4_hudro ;
        - [ ]file pull request
### Other: 
- [X ] review paper (by 3 June)
