# README


This repository contains code related to exploring how to create hydrological trait-based PFTs, to subsequently assess their global distribution in LPJ-GUESS-HYD.


Kleaf is no longer simulated by the trait network, but will be provided based on mean or median values from the file Kleaf_mining_rough_template-DL_updated_v3.xlsx
